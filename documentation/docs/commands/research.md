# `research`

The `research` command is the second step in the Gizmo research workflow. It takes the research plan generated by the `plan` command and executes the actual research, searching the internet for information, analyzing the findings, and creating well-organized reports.

## Syntax

```bash
gizmo research -p <plan_file> [-o <output_dir>] [-m <memory_dir>]
```

## Description

When you run the `research` command, Gizmo:

1. Reads your research plan
2. For each step in the plan:
   - Searches the internet for relevant information
   - Analyzes and synthesizes the collected data
   - Creates a well-written report
3. Generates a comprehensive summary of all findings

This process transforms your research plan into a collection of detailed, well-organized reports that thoroughly address your original research question.

## Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-p, --plan` | Path to your research plan file (created with the `plan` command) | None (required) |
| `-o, --output` | Directory where your final research documents will be saved | `output` in the current directory |
| `-m, --memory` | Directory for temporary files created during research | `.memory` in the current directory |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Execute research using a plan file:
gizmo research -p research_plan.md -o my_research_results

# Using default output directory:
gizmo research -p dog_research_plan.md

# With custom memory directory:
gizmo research -p farming_plan.md -o farming_research -m farming_memory
```

## Output Files

The `research` command generates several types of files:

### Final Research Results

These files are saved in your output directory (specified with `-o` or the default `output/`):

- `plan.md`: A copy of your research plan
- `step1.md`, `step2.md`, etc.: Detailed reports for each research step
- `summary_final.md`: Comprehensive summary of all findings

### Working Files (Memory)

These temporary files are stored in the memory directory (specified with `-m` or the default `.memory/`):

- `stepX_search.md`: Raw information collected from web searches
- `stepX_analysis.md`: Analysis of the collected information
- `stepX_summary.md`: Brief summary of findings for each step

## File Structure

```
project/
├── .memory/                  # Working files (temporary)
│   ├── stepX_search.md       # Raw information from web searches
│   ├── stepX_analysis.md     # Analysis of collected information
│   └── stepX_summary.md      # Brief summary of findings
│
└── output/                   # Final research results
    ├── plan.md               # Your research plan
    ├── step1.md              # Detailed report for step 1
    ├── step2.md              # Detailed report for step 2
    ├── ...                   # Additional step reports
    └── summary_final.md      # Comprehensive summary of all findings
```

## Working with Results

After running your research, you can view the results:

```bash
# View your final summary:
cat my_research_results/summary_final.md

# View a specific research step:
cat my_research_results/step1.md

# Open all research files (macOS example):
open my_research_results/*.md
```

The `summary_final.md` file contains a comprehensive overview of all research findings and is a great place to start reviewing your results.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the research process:

- **API Key Errors**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set as shown in the installation section
- **"Too Many Requests"**: OpenAI may limit request frequency. Try using a smaller plan size, waiting a few minutes, or breaking your research into smaller projects
- **Network Errors**: Check your internet connection and try again. Gizmo has built-in retry mechanisms for temporary network issues
