Based on the current information available about writing README files for open source projects, especially for CLI tools related to AI, here is a structured research plan to guide you in creating a well-organized README template.

## Research Plan

1. **Understand the Purpose and Importance of README Files**
   - Research why README files are crucial, especially for open source projects.
   - Explore the role of README files in helping users understand and use the software.

2. **Analyze Best Practices for README Files in Open Source Projects**
   - Investigate best practices for writing clear, informative, and engaging README files.
   - Identify key elements that should be included in README files for open source projects.

3. **Focus on CLI Tools Documentation**
   - Study the specific documentation needs for Command-Line Interface (CLI) tools.
   - Understand how to effectively document commands, flags, options, and usage examples for CLI tools.

4. **Explore Documentation for AI-Related Projects**
   - Look into specific challenges and considerations when documenting tools that involve AI engines.
   - Consider how to communicate the functionality and limitations of AI components.

5. **Identify Common Structures of High-Quality README Files**
   - Collect examples of well-structured README files from similar open source projects.
   - Note common sections and their purposes such as Introduction, Installation, Usage, and Contribution.

6. **Review README Generators and Tools**
   - Examine the advantages and limitations of using README generators like README-AI.
   - Evaluate their output against best practices to ensure comprehensive README files.

7. **Draft a README Template for CLI Tools Utilizing AI Engines**
   - Develop a template structure that includes necessary sections tailored to CLI tools in the AI domain.
   - Include placeholders for each section to guide users on what information to include.

8. **Refine the Template with Community Insights**
   - Seek feedback from developer communities or forums to ensure the template meets the needs of end-users.
   - Incorporate any additional sections or modifications based on community feedback.

## Conclusion

This plan aims to provide clarity and thoroughness in your research. Following these steps will help you create an effective README template, correct for open-source CLI tools using AI engines, that developers can easily adapt and use to enhance their project's documentation.
