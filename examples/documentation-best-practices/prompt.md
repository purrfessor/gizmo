I want you to research and explain the best practices for writing and maintaining documentation for open source software projects. This includes everything from initial setup and structure to ongoing maintenance, contribution workflows, and community involvement. The goal is to understand what makes documentation effective, accessible, and sustainable over time.

Your findings should include practical recommendations, real-world examples, and actionable guidelines that can be applied to both small and large open source projects. Cover topics such as documentation structure, writing style, tooling, automation, and strategies for encouraging contributions from the community.

In the practical part focus on building documentation with mkdocs.
