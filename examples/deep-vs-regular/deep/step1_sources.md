### 1. [Delivery Mechanism - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/delivery-mechanism)
   A "Delivery Mechanism" in computer science refers to the method used to transfer messages between roles and players, such as 'push' and 'pull' mechanisms.

### 2. [Message Delivery - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/message-delivery)
   Message receiving and message delivery are two distinct operations; a delivery rule is an additional assumption about the channel-process interface.
