## Exploring RabbitMQ and Google Pub/Sub for Event-Based Chat Systems in Microservices

### Objective
The objective is to delve into the architectural aspects and design principles of RabbitMQ and Google Pub/Sub. This exploration aims to assess their compatibility with the requirements of an event-driven chat system, emphasizing their suitability in a microservices environment.

### 1. RabbitMQ

**Architecture and Design Philosophy**
- **Message Broker**: Functions as an intermediary facilitating asynchronous communication among systems.
- **Reliability and Scalability**: Ensures dependable message delivery and supports load balancing essential for distributed systems.
- **Protocol Support**: Utilizes the AMQP protocol, enabling messaging through exchanges, queues, and bindings.

**Key Features**
- **Flexibility**: Supports multiple protocols like MQTT and STOMP, enhancing versatility.
- **Use Cases**: Primarily employed for intricate routing scenarios, background processing, and establishing loose coupling between microservices.
