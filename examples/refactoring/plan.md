Here's a structured research plan to guide your refactoring process for the CLI tool designed to orchestrate local agents utilizing large language models (LLMs). The plan integrates insights from modern Python CLI development and LLM agent orchestration architecture.

### Research Steps

1. **Foundational Understanding of Python CLI Development**
   - Explore [Mastering CLI Tools: A Beginner's Guide](https://techbuzzonline.com/building-cli-tools-python-guide/) to grasp basic concepts and tools for building command-line interfaces (CLI) in Python.
   - Review [Best Practices for Structuring a Python CLI Application](https://medium.com/@ernestwinata/best-practices-for-structuring-a-python-cli-application-1bc8f8a57369) to understand effective application architectures.

2. **Advanced CLI Development Techniques**
   - Study [Creating and Packaging Command-Line Tools](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/creating-command-line-tools/) for guidance on packaging your CLI tool as a standalone application.
   - Consider insights from [Mastering Command-Line Interfaces in Python](https://dev.to/usooldatascience/mastering-command-line-interfaces-cli-in-python-a-comprehensive-guide-10bc) on automating tasks and enhancing flexibility with Python's libraries.

3. **Aesthetic and Usability Considerations**
   - Learn about creating visually appealing interfaces by reading [Building Beautiful Command Line Interfaces with Python](https://codeburst.io/building-beautiful-command-line-interfaces-with-python-26c7e1bb54df).

4. **Understanding LLM Agent Orchestration**
   - Explore high-level insights into LLM orchestration frameworks in the article [LLM Orchestration in 2025: Frameworks + Best Practices](https://orq.ai/blog/llm-orchestration).
   - Dive into foundational concepts with [LLM-Based Agents: Architecture, Best Practices, and Frameworks](https://verticalserve.medium.com/genai-llm-based-agents-architecture-best-practices-and-frameworks-6dba19d194fb).

5. **Practical Implementation Techniques for LLMs**
   - Consult [Building Effective AI Agents by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) for pragmatic advice on implementing LLM-based agents with simple, composable patterns.
   - Review [LLM Agent Orchestration: A Step by Step Guide](https://www.ibm.com/think/tutorials/llm-agent-orchestration-with-langchain-and-granite) for detailed procedural guidance.

6. **Common Pitfalls and Challenges**
   - Analyze [Understand the LLM Agent Orchestration](https://medium.com/scisharp/understand-the-llm-agent-orchestration-043ebfaead1f) to identify design challenges and strategic solutions.

### Conclusion

This plan will guide you through comprehensively understanding the landscape of Python CLI development and LLM agent orchestration. By following these steps, you'll gather key insights to structure, extend, and maintain your CLI tool effectively. Each research source provides unique value, from basic principles to advanced orchestration strategies, ensuring a well-rounded approach to your refactoring task.
