Here's a structured research plan to guide your refactoring process for the CLI tool, focusing on best practices in Python CLI development, LLM agent orchestration architecture, and modern Python development techniques:

1. **Understand Python CLI Application Structure**
   - Explore best practices for structuring Python CLI applications. Analyze resources like [this blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/@ernestwinata/best-practices-for-structuring-a-python-cli-application-1bc8f8a57369) and [Real Python's reference](https://realpython.com/python-application-layouts/) to understand common application layouts and project structures.

2. **Explore LLM Agent Orchestration Architecture**
   - Investigate the architecture and best practices for LLM-based agent systems. Key resources include [an overview of LLM orchestration best practices](https://verticalserve.medium.com/genai-llm-based-agents-architecture-best-practices-and-frameworks-6dba19d194fb) and [real-world case studies](https://www.zenml.io/blog/llm-agents-in-production-architectures-challenges-and-best-practices).

3. **Learn Modern Python Development Techniques**
   - Focus on static typing and the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach in modern Python. Resources such as the [GitHub guide on type hints](https://github.com/panaverse/learn-modern-python) and [OOP design patterns](https://medium.com/@cautaerts/all-23-oop-software-design-patterns-with-examples-in-python-cac1d3f4f4d5) can provide valuable insights.

4. **Identify CLI Best Practices and Common Pitfalls**
   - Dive deeper into Python CLI best practices by reviewing guides like [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/scenarios/cli/) and the [Coderivers blog](https://coderivers.org/blog/cli-python/), focusing on robust and user-friendly application design.

5. **Evaluate Advanced LLM Agent Strategies**
   - Analyze advanced architectural strategies for LLM agents, including framework selection and deployment challenges, by examining articles such as [ZenML's insights](https://zenuml.com/blog/2024/07/23/2024/optimizing-llm-agents-production-architectural-guide) and [future trends in LLM agent architecture](https://orq.ai/blog/llm-orchestration).

6. **Implementing Static Types and OOP in Python**
   - Implement and benefit from static typing and OOP features in Python, as illustrated in resources like the [GitHub page on modern Python](https://github.com/octallium/modern-python-101) and insights on [advanced class features](https://medium.com/@ramanbazhanau/mastering-advanced-oop-concepts-in-python-advanced-class-features-a8790fa2b5a2).

7. **Extend and Maintain the Codebase**
   - Develop strategies for extending and maintaining your Python codebase by synthesizing insights from all the mentioned resources to form a cohesive plan.


By following these steps, you will be equipped with the resources and understanding needed to successfully refactor and enhance your CLI tool, ensuring it is built on modern and robust architectural principles.
