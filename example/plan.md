# Research Plan

1. Research the different breeds of hamsters commonly kept as pets, noting their characteristics such as size, temperament, and energy levels.

2. Investigate the natural behaviors and instincts of hamsters that might be conducive to serving as a 'guard' or alert animal, such as sensitivity to new stimuli, vocalization, or alertness.

3. Examine any known instances or anecdotes of hamsters being used as a type of alert animal or demonstrating protective behaviors, and evaluate their effectiveness in these roles.

4. Identify specific breeds of hamsters that are known for being more vocal or active, as these traits might lend themselves better to the idea of a hamster acting in a 'guard' capacity.

5. Compare the responsiveness and trainability of various hamster breeds, as a more trainable breed might better adapt to any intended alert roles.

6. Explore expert opinions from veterinarians or hamster breeders on the feasibility and practicality of using hamsters as alert animals, focusing on any recommendations they might have regarding breed selection.

7. Evaluate alternative small pets that might be more suited to a 'guard' role, understanding that comparative insights might help in addressing the original query with a more feasible solution.
